# Quizzes


## Quiz 6

Provide a graph example for which Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms generate different kinds of minimum spanning trees.  Explain how these trees are generated.  If you cannot find an example, explain why these algorithms always generate the same minimum spanning tree given any kind of graph.

## Quiz 9

Unlike the [Ford–Fulkerson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm) that uses depth-first search to find augmenting paths, the [Edmonds–Karp algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm) uses breadth-first search to find augmenting paths.  What is the advantage of using the Edmonds–Karp algorithm over the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm?  Explain your answer.

## Quiz 10

For each k, how many times are the following methods called recursively?
* `RHanoi#solve(List<String> int, char, char, char)`.
* `DHanoi#solve(List<String>, int, char, char, char, Map<String,int[]>)`.

Is there any clear pattern between k and the number of the method calls in each class? Explain the pattern if there is one.
